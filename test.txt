There’s evidence of use of upsum as far back
as the early 2000s, though it’s only in the
last couple of years that the word has really
gained ground. It’s one of those neologisms
that sounds very much like a ‘made-up’ word,
some clumsy bit of creativity that a person
thought of when reaching for a noun alternative
to the phrasal verb sum up (= ‘to give a summary
of something’). It may well have started life as
journalist jargon, but through random exposure somehow
made the leap from a reporter’s idiolect to the wider
world. The noun derivation summing-up is of course a
well-established forerunner, but is chiefly legal terminology
– a statement made by a lawyer or judge that gives a 
summary of the evidence in a court case
